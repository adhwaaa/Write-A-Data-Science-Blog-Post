A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project


## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Black Friday Dataset from Kaggle to better understand:

Question 1: list the top 20 spending users spent most during Black Friday.
Question 2: What is users distribution by Age and Gender Group?.
Question 3: List the top 20 products are most popular during Black Friday.
Question 4: Look at the users again, this time focus on group by Occupation in different city.
Question 5: Correlation between Gender, Age, Occupation, City_Category, Stay_In_Current_City_Years, Marital_Status, Product_Category_x vs Purchase. Understanding these questions may provide some advice for the sellers to better understand the customer purchase behavior against different products so that the seller can prepare for the next shopping season well.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

BlackFriday.csv       - This file contains 550,000 observations about the black Friday in a retail store, it contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical. It contains missing values.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/p/ab94094127b8/edit).
